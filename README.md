## Rules
The basic rules of Dots and Boxes are players take turns connecting lines on a grid of dots. If a player connects a box they get a point and can make an additional move. When there are no more lines to draw, the points are added up and the player with the most completed boxes wins.

This version has a twist.

## Chords
In this version, each player is assigned a chord. Player one plays C major. Player two is stuck with the far less popular Bb sustained 4.

Each line added to a box adds a note from each players chord until a blend of the two chords (or if a player is fortunate enough to draw all 4 lines of a box their full chord) plays.

The winner gets to hear their boxes played into a unique composition for each game.

## Next Steps
1. Given time and energy I'd like to make each note glow as it's played.
2. A responsive layout would be nice.
